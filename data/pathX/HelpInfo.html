			This is pathX European Football Club Juve & Italy Special Edition.The
			game will lead you all around the Europe, you will set your foot on some
			extravagant clubs, as well as some historical Gaints 
			currently fading off. Of course, the best Football Club ever.</p><br>
            
            <h1>GAME PLAY</h1><hr/>
			<p>The game got 20 levels, for each level you will start at a Football club
			after a sucessful robbery and try as hard as you can to move your car to
			the rally point(Italian National Football Team Flag) expect for level 20
			Level-Turino (Levels will be unlocked in order when you success one).
			Meanwhile,you will aslo pay attention to all the assholes
			that want to compromise you. They are:</br></br></p>
			<p>
			<b>Bandits:</b> They are relatively the nicest assholes in the game, caught by 
			them, you only lose 10% of your plunder for that particular level. And
			they wander in a traceable pattern, they always start at your rally site
			and find top 3 longest intersects, randomly choose one and move there 
			along the shortest path and then choose another, moving there in the 
			same way.</br></br></p>
			<p>
			<b>Cops:</b> They are really assholes, you definitely want to avoid them, Or
			you will be driven out and bribe these M***-F***ers with 10% of your
			total balance. Nice thing is they patrol along a loop, but still once upon
			an intersect they will choose to go CW or CCW, and they can get 
			through close intersects and oneWay Roads.</br></br></p>
			<p>
			<b>Xiluo(Refer to <a href="http://www.cr7underwear.com/">CR7</a>. Not Obama by the way): </b>
			Be careful!!!!!! They are nothing but hounds with rabies, wants nothing
			but gives you a lethal bite. One bite reduces 20% of your Car speed.
			Five, you are sitting-ducks. And they always randomly wander between 
			intersects with no way to predict. Assholes, ain't they.</br></br></p>
			<p>
			<b>Your own Car:</b>you can control the car by clicking on the node you want
			or press on the car and drag to the wanted node, then a shortest will be
			planned. One thing to notice is, Once your car is on the road, you can 
			either to let it go back or move forward and stop at the adjacent Nodes.</br></br></p>
