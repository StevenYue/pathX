This is pathX European Football Club Juve & Italy Special Edition.The
game will lead you all around the Europe, you will set your foot on some
unprecedently  extravagant  clubs, as  well as  some  historical  Gaints 
currently fading off. Of course, the best Football Club ever.

***GAME PLAY***
The game got 20 levels, for each level you will start at a Football club
after a sucessful robbery and try as hard as you can to move your car to
the rally point(Italian National Football Team Flag) expect for level 20
Level-Turino (Levels will be unlocked in order when you success one).
Meanwhile,you will aslo pay attention to all the assholes
that want to compromise you. They are:

Bandits: They are relatively the nicest assholes in the game, caught by 
them, you only lose 10% of your plunder for that particular level. And
they wander in a traceable pattern, they always start at your rally site
and find top 3 longest intersects, randomly choose one and move  there 
along the  shortest  path and then choose another, moving there in the 
same way.

Cops: They are really assholes, you definitely want to avoid them, Or
you will be driven out and bribe these M***-F***ers with 10% of your
total balance. Nice thing is they patrol along a loop, but still once upon
an  intersect they will  choose to go  CW or CCW, and they can get 
through close intersects and oneWay Roads.

Xiluo(Refer to CR7 - Underwear Brand. Not Obama by the way): 
Be careful!!!!!! They are nothing but hounds with rabies, wants nothing
but gives you a lethal bite. One bite reduces 20% of your Car speed.
Five, you are sitting-ducks. And they always randomly wander between 
intersects with no way to predict. Assholes, ain't they.

Your own Car:you can control the car by clicking on the node you want
or press on the car and drag to the wanted node, then a shortest will be
planned. One thing to notice is, Once your car is on the road, you can 
either to let it go back or move forward and stop at the adjacent Nodes.
